            <h2>Location Of Sri Lanka</h2>
            <div class="location">
                <p>Sri Lanka is an independent island nation located in the Indian Ocean just southeast of the tip of the Indian subcontinent. The name change may be one reason Sri Lanka isn't overly familiar to many Americans. If you have tea in the cupboard labeled as "Ceylon," it came from Sri Lanka.

                    Sri Lanka was a British colony until obtaining independence in 1948. Interestingly, Sri Lanka is claimed to be the oldest democracy in Asia.
                    
                    Here are a few specifics about the location of Sri Lanka:
                    
                    Along with India, Nepal, and the Maldives, Sri Lanka is considered a part of South Asia.
                    Sri Lanka is in the Indian Ocean, almost rowboat distance from the southeast tip of India. It is located just a little southwest of the Bay of Bengal.
                    The Gulf of Mannar and Palk Strait are the two shallow waterways separating India and Sri Lanka.
                    The Maldives, an island nation and popular honeymoon destination in Asia, are southwest of Sri Lanka.
                    Sumatra, the largest island belonging only to Indonesia, lies far across the Indian Ocean to the southeast of Sri Lanka.
                    Northeast from Sri Lanka, across the Bay of Bengal, is the coast of Myanmar (Burma).
                    Sri Lanka is thought to have once been connected to India via an 18-mile-long land bridge, however, only limestone shoals remain. Large cargo ships transporting Indian exports from Mumbai to the rest of Asia cannot sail through the shallow waters between the two countries; they must pass all the way around Sri Lanka.</p>

            <h2>Climate in Sri Lanka</h2>
            <div class="climate">
                <p>Due to location slightly North (6-10o) of the Equator in the Indian Ocean, the climate of Sri-Lanka is tropical, is relatively wet, and has two seasons. From May to October, the winds over Sri-Lanka are Westerly to North-Westerly (i.e winds come from the west). While from December to March, the winds over Sri-Lanka are North-Easterly. The wind speeds rises in the land surfaces in the months of June to September and from December to February. Regionally the average wind speeds are high in the South-Eastern and North-Western extremes of the island and in the mountain passes.

                    The island is humid all over Sri-Lanka and the relative humidity is over 65% usually. In the coasts, it rises to 90% in the wetter seasons. There are dry desiccating effects due to mountain effects in the windier months and the humidity drops in the eastern region from June to September. There is a weaker dessicating effect on the western mountain slopes.
                    
                    Sri-Lanka receives 1,800 mm of rainfall on average annually distributed unevenly ranging from 500 to 5000 mm/year. The rainfall follows a bimodal climatology with the main rains from September to December and subsidiary rains from April to June. <br/>The Eastern and Western Hill Slopes garner orographic (mountain induced) rainfall from December to March (North-Easterly winds) and May to October (Westerly wind) respectively.
                    
                    The North-East receives cyclonic rainfall from November to December from the storms and cyclonic systems that are steered from the Bay of Bengal by the North-Easterly winds towards Sri-Lanka. Once they make landfall, these systems can dissipate quickly unless they are particularly strong.
                    
                    The mean annual temperature of the country is 27 oC with lower temperatures in the mountains that rise to 2500M.Temperature drops during December and January and increases from April to September. The mean daily range is approximately 6 oC. These temperatures are more moderate than what is typical for such latitudes during the Northern Hemisphere summer from June to August. We can attribute this to the cooling effect of the oceans during the warmest months.</p>

            <h2>Culture and Traditions in Sri Lanka</h2>
            <div class="location">
                <p>Sri Lanka is one of the few countries with a diverse cultural heritage. The culture is distinctive in and of itself and hence adds to the Sri Lankan identity. Sri Lankan culture contains several practices and rituals that stretch back more than 2000 years and have been passed down from generation to generation. The most notable characteristic of Sri Lankan culture is its colourful festivals, which are one of the primary tourist attractions. Religion has a significant impact on Sri Lankan culture and traditions.

                    Art, architecture, sculpture, and even food are frequently used to depict Sri Lankan culture. Some might argue that Sri Lanka has a more traditional culture, which is clearly impacted by the country’s major faiths, such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and so on. The Sri Lankan way of life is very basic and full of humility and contentment, which is one of the reasons why Sri Lankans have such a strong feeling of appreciation for the simple things in life, such as nature.
                    
                    One of the most distinctive aspects of the culture is its Indian and European influences. Because most Sri Lankan monarchs married Indian princesses, they assimilated Indian culture while retaining a distinct Sri Lankan identity. European influence arose as a result of invasions by the Dutch, Portuguese, and, eventually, the British. Hospitality is also a significant feature of the culture, making Sri Lankans one of the world’s friendliest people.</p>

            <h2>History of Sri Lanka</h2>
            <div class="climate">
                <p>Sri Lanka has been continuously inhabited for more than 2 million years, with the original inhabitants descended from Stone Age hunter gatherers. Immigration arrived from northern India around the 5th century BCE, forming the basis of the modern Sinhalese population. Tamils from the south of India arrived approximately two centuries later, settling in Jaffna. In contrast to the largely Buddhist Sinhalese, most Tamils are Hindu or Christian and form a minority in the Sri Lankan population.<br/>

                    The legendary north Indian Prince Vijaya and his 700 followers landed near Puttallam and formed the first Sinhalese kingdom around Anuradhapura. In the 3rd century BCE, Buddhism arrived from India at Mihintale.<br/> Early Buddhist emissaries brought a cutting from the Bodhi tree under which Lord Buddha attained enlightenment; it survives in Anuradhapura and is an important pilgrimage site. Tensions with Tamil Kingdoms in India were never far away and a Pandyan invasion in 432 led to the establishment of the rock fortress at Sigiriya as the capital. Legends surrounding the fortress also tell a story of King Kassapa building the residence on top of the rock after murdering his own father. Following Kassapa’s short rule, the capital returned to Anuradhapura before moving to Polonnaruwa in 1070 where it remained for 150 years.
                    
                    Kandy came into prominence after the Portuguese arrived in 1505 and was soon the only independent kingdom in Sri Lanka, falling to the British in 1815 after defying the Portuguese and the Dutch for 300 years. By 1518 the Portuguese had established good relations with the King and were allowed to build a fort at Colombo. Meanwhile, the Dutch established a trading fort in Galle. It wasn’t long until the Dutch East India Company controlled most of Ceylon.
                    
                    A constitution was written and some concessions provided but it wasn’t until the 1947 constitution came into effect that Ceylon gained independence in 1948. </p>

                    Ceylon ironwood (naa) was declared the national tree of Sri Lanka on 26 February 1986. It was chosen as the national tree due to its endemism in Sri Lanka.<br/>
                    The Sri Lankan junglefowl is the official national bird.The blue sapphire was declared the national gemstone of Sri Lanka.<br/>
                    The national anthem of Sri Lanka "Sri Lanka Matha" is believed to have been written by Rabindranath Tagore and later composed by Ananda Samarakoon in 1940 before the island nation's independence from the British. In 1951, it became the national anthem of Sri Lanka.
