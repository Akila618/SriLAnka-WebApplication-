        <h1>Matara</h1>

        <p class="describe">
            Matara is a busy town booming with commercial activities. Situated 160 kilometers from the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo, the coastal town may not feature highly on the lists of tourists. The high rise buildings housing some of the leading multinational companies may not seem like an attractive tourist landmark in Matara. However, that does not mean that Matara holds next to negligible tourist value. The Nilwala River cuts through the city of Matara forming stunning views along its path. The river falls into the Indian Ocean at Totamuna. Additionally, the beachfront paints beautiful scenes along the coast of the city.

            <img src="https://lanka-houses.com/media/Sightseeings/Matara_Fort/1.jpg" width="600" height="400">
            <p class="statement">As the name suggests, the Star Fort is constructed in the shape of a star. It was built by the Dutch to prevent attacks from external enemies. The fort is composed out of 6-points forming a star which has a point facing every direction. Each point is bolstered with two large canons. Still protected from all sides by a deep moat, the Star Fort houses a well in the center that offered water within the territories. Additionally, two prisons are also present within the forts premises. It was later occupied by the British to carry out administrative work. The Fort stands even to this day as a remnant of colonialism in Sri Lanka.</p>
