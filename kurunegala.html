            <img src="https://www.krazybutterfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Kurunegala-Ridi-Viharaya.jpg" width="600" height="400">
            <p class="statement">The temple got its name as the silver temple because it has been built on a rocky outcrop over a mine which is of silver. There are two shrines which are superimposed and partly carved out of the rocks. They make up the Silver Temple which is also known as Ridi Viharaya and it was first built by King Duttu Gemunu in the 2C BCE. There are many caves in here and in one cave there is a long reclining idol of Buddha which has an approximate height of about 9 m. The walls of the temple are covered with paintings which depict divinities. A person could enjoy the spectacular view of the mountain range of Knuckles from dagoba at the top of the hill.</p>

            <img src="https://www.watchinglanka.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Munneswaram-temple-in-Sri-Lanka-1-min-640x480.jpg" width="600" height="400">
            <p class="statement">Munneswaram Temple is considered to be one of the most important sanctuaries in Sri Lanka which has been devoted to Shiva. It is believed that Durga is invincible, Shiva teaches wisdom and Vishnu is the protector. It is considered to be the home of the medieval sculpture of Hindu Pandya who reigned in Southern India.

            <p class="statement">There is a huge lion staircase which leads to the temple of Buddha with a sacred tooth relic. These stairs are half-way up to the hillside and they are considered to be a masterpiece of the citadel of Yapahuwa but unfortunately, now they are in ruins. The granite rock which emerges from thick vegetation against which the fortress of Bhuvanekabahu I has been built was earlier a lower town and a palace. Now it has become a striking site which provides an excellent view of the countryside which surrounds it.</p>

            <p class="statement">This place is usually out of the sight of tourists as it is very far from the track of tourists. There are a royal palace, two monasteries and a dagoba ramparts which is all in the countryside and is hidden. These places are all that has remains of Panduwasnuwara which was the capital of Land of the South in Sri Lanka. It has been built by Parakrama the Great in 12C. The temple of sacred tooth relic has been restored and maintained outside the ramparts. There is a small museum here in which the artefacts from the site are preserved and displayed.</p>

The other option is to take the natural pathway or the main road which is adjacent from top to bottom.
